<body>Provides the client-side aspect of the heritrix integration self test. 
    <p>The <i>selftest</i> webapp is the repository for the serverside of the 
    intergration test.</p> <p>The integration self test is run from the command 
    line. Invocation makes the crawler go up against itself trawling the 
    <i>selftest</i> webapp. When done, the product -- arc and log files -- are 
    analyzed by code herein to verify test pass or fail.</p> <p>The integration 
    self test is the aggregation of multiple individual tests each testing a 
    particular crawler aspect. For example, the <i>Robots</i> test validates 
    the crawler's parse of <i>robots.txt</i>. Each test comprises a directory 
    under the <i>selftest</i> webapp named for the test into which we put the 
    server pages that express the scenario to test, and a class from this 
    package named for test webapp directory w/ a <code>SelfTest</code> suffix. 
    The selftest class verifies test success. Each selftest class subclasses 
    <code>org.archive.crawler.selftest.SelfTestCase</code> which is itself 
    a subclass of <code>org.junit.TestCase</code>). All tests need to be 
    registered with the {@link org.archive.crawler.selftest.AllSelfTestCases} 
    class and must live in the org.archive.crawler.selftest package. The class
    {@link org.archive.crawler.selftest.SelfTestCrawlJobHandler} 
    manages the running of selftest.</p> 
    <p>Run one test only by passing its name as the option value to the 
    selftest argument.</p>
    <p>The first crop of self tests are 
    derived from tests developed by Parker Thompson &lt; pt at archive dot org 
    &gt;. See <a 
    href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/archive-crawler/Tests/">Tests</a>. 
    These tests in turn look to have been derived from <a 
    href="http://www.searchtools.com/test/">Testing Search Indexing 
    Systems1</a>. </p> <h3>Adding a Self Test</h3> <p>TODO</p> <h2>Related
