REST API
========

This manual describes the REST application programming interface (API)
of the Heritrix Web crawler.  Heritrix is the Internet Archive's open
source, extensible, Web-scale, archival-quality Web crawler. For more
information about Heritrix, visit \ http://crawler.archive.org/.

This document is intended for application developers and administrators
interested in controlling the Heritrix Web crawler through its REST API.

Any client that supports HTTPS can be used to invoke the Heritrix API.
The examples in this document use the command line tool curl which
is typically found in most unix environments. Curl is 
\ `available <https://curl.haxx.se/download.html>`__ for many systems
including Windows.

Create New Job
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. http:post:: https://(heritrixhost):8443/engine [action=create]

   Creates a new crawl job. It uses the default configuration provided
   by the profile-defaults profile.

   :form action: must be ``create``
   :form createpath: the name of the new job

   **HTML Example:**

   .. code:: bash

      curl -v -d "createpath=myjob&action=create" -k -u admin:admin --anyauth --location \
        https://localhost:8443/engine

   **XML Example:**

   .. code:: bash

      curl -v -d "createpath=myjob&action=create" -k -u admin:admin --anyauth --location \
        -H "Accept: application/xml" https://localhost:8443/engine

Add Job Directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. http:post:: https://(heritrixhost):8443/engine [action=add]

   Adds a new job directory to the Heritrix configuration. The directory must
   contain a cxml configuration file.

   :form action: must be ``add``
   :form addpath: the job directory to add


   **HTML Example:**

   .. code:: bash

      curl -v -d "action=add&addpath=/Users/hstern/job" -k -u admin:admin --anyauth --location https://localhost:8443/engine

   **XML Example:**

   .. code:: bash

      curl -v -d "action=add&addpath=/Users/hstern/job" -k -u admin:admin --anyauth --location -H "Accept: application/xml" https://localhost:8443/engine

Build Job Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. http:post:: https://(heritrixhost):8443/engine/job/(jobname) [action=build]

   Builds the job configuration for the chosen job. It reads an XML descriptor
   file and uses Spring to build the Java objects that are necessary for
   running the crawl. Before a crawl can be run it must be built.
   
   :form action: must be ``build``

   **HTML Example:**

   .. code:: bash

       curl -v -d "action=build" -k -u admin:admin --anyauth --location https://localhost:8443/engine/job/myjob

   **XML Example:**

   .. code:: bash

       curl -v -d "action=build" -k -u admin:admin --anyauth --location -H "Accept: application/xml" https://localhost:8443/engine/job/myjob

Launch Job
~~~~~~~~~~

.. http:post:: https://(heritrixhost):8443/engine/job/(jobname) [action=launch]

   Launches a crawl job. The job can be launched in the "paused" state or the
   "unpaused" state. If launched in the "unpaused" state the job will
   immediately begin crawling.

   :form action: must be ``launch``

   :form checkpoint: optional field: If supplied, Heritrix will attempt to launch from a checkpoint. Should be the name of a checkpoint (e.g. ``cp00001-20180102121229``) or the special value ``latest``, which will automatically select the most recent checkpoint. If no ``checkpoint`` is specified (or if the ``latest`` checkpoint is requested and there are no valid checkpoints) a new crawl will be launched.

   **HTML Example:**

   .. code:: bash

       curl -v -d "action=launch" -k -u admin:admin --anyauth --location https://localhost:8443/engine/job/myjob

   **XML Example:**

   .. code:: bash

       curl -v -d "action=launch" -k -u admin:admin --anyauth --location -H "Accept: application/xml" https://localhost:8443/engine/job/myjob

Rescan Job Directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. http:post:: https://(heritrixhost):8443/engine [action=rescan]

   Rescans the main job directory and returns an HTML page containing all the
   job names. It also returns information about the jobs, such as the location
   of the job configuration file and the number of job launches.

   :form action: must be ``rescan``

   **HTML Example:**

   .. code:: bash

       curl -v -d "action=rescan" -k -u admin:admin --anyauth --location https://localhost:8443/engine

   **XML Example:**

   .. code:: bash

       curl -v -d "action=rescan" -k -u admin:admin --anyauth --location -H "Accept: application/xml" https://localhost:8443/engine

Pause Job
~~~~~~~~~

.. http:post:: https://(heritrixhost):8443/engine/job/(jobname) [action=pause]

   Pauses an unpaused job. No crawling will occur while a job is paused.

   :form action: must be ``pause``

   **HTML Example:**

   .. code:: bash

       curl -v -d "action=pause" -k -u admin:admin --anyauth --location https://localhost:8443/engine/job/myjob

   of a job launched in the paused state) if possible.

   :form action: must be ``unpause``

   **HTML Example:**

   .. code:: bash

       curl -v -d "action=unpause" -k -u admin:admin --anyauth --location https://localhost:8443/engine/job/myjob

   **XML Example:**

   .. code:: bash

       curl -v -d "action=unpause" -k -u admin:admin --anyauth --location -H "Accept: application/xml" https://localhost:8443/engine/job/myjob

       curl -v -d "action=terminate" -k -u admin:admin --anyauth --location -H "Accept: application/xml" https://localhost:8443/engine/job/myjob

Teardown Job
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. http:post:: https://(heritrixhost):8443/engine/job/(jobname) [action=teardown]

   Removes the Spring code that is used to run the job. Once a job is torn down
   it must be rebuilt in order to run.

   :form action: must be ``teardown``

   **HTML Example:**

   .. code:: bash

       curl -v -d "action=teardown" -k -u admin:admin --anyauth --location https://localhost:8443/engine/job/myjob

       curl -v -d "action=teardown" -k -u admin:admin --anyauth --location -H "Accept: application/xml" https://localhost:8443/engine/job/myjob

Copy Job
~~~~~~~~

.. http:post:: https://(heritrixhost):8443/engine/job/(jobname) [copyTo]

   Copies an existing job configuration to a new job configuration. If the "as
   profile" checkbox is selected, than the job configuration is copied as a
   non-runnable profile configuration.

   :form copyTo: the name of the new job or profile configuration

   :form asProfile: whether to copy the job as a runnable configuration or as a
     non-runnable profile. The value ``on`` means the job will be copied as a
     profile. If omitted the job will be copied as a runnable configuration.

   **HTML Example:**

   .. code:: bash

       curl -v -d "copyTo=mycopy&asProfile=on" -k -u admin:admin --anyauth --location https://localhost:8443/engine/job/myjob

Checkpoint Job
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. http:post:: https://(heritrixhost):8443/engine/job/(jobname) [action=checkpoint]

   This API checkpoints the chosen job. Checkpointing writes the current state
   of a crawl to the file system so that the crawl can be recovered if it
   fails.

   :form action: must be ``checkpoint``

   **HTML Example:**

   .. code:: bash

       curl -v -d "action=checkpoint" -k -u admin:admin --anyauth --location https://localhost:8443/engine/job/myjob

Execute Script in Job
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. http:post:: https://(heritrixhost):8443/engine/job/(jobname)/script

   Executes a script. The script can be written as Beanshell, ECMAScript,
   Groovy, or AppleScript.

   :form engine: the script engine to use. One of ``beanshell``, ``js``,
     ``groovy`` or ``AppleScriptEngine``.

   :form script: the script code to execute

   **HTML Example:**

   .. code:: bash

       curl -v -d "engine=beanshell&script=System.out.println%28%22test%22%29%3B" -k -u admin:admin --anyauth --location https://localhost:8443/engine/job/myjob/script

   **XML Example:**

   .. code:: bash

       curl -v -d "engine=beanshell&script=System.out.println%28%22test%22%29%3B" -k -u admin:admin --anyauth --location -H "Accept: application/xml" https://localhost:8443/engine/job/myjob/script

Submitting a CXML Job Configuration File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. http:put:: https://(heritrixhost):8443/engine/job/(jobname)/jobdir/crawler-beans.cxml

   Submits the contents of a CXML file for a chosen job. CXML files are the
   configuration files used to control a crawl job. Each job has a single CXML
   file.

   **Example:**

   .. code:: bash

       curl -v -T my-crawler-beans.cxml -k -u admin:admin --anyauth --location https://localhost:8443/engine/job/myjob/jobdir/crawler-beans.cxml

   :statuscode 200: On success, the Heritrix REST API will return a HTTP 200 with no body.

Heritrix is run with an administrative username and password of "admin."

About the REST implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Representational State Transfer (REST) is a software architecture for
distributed hypermedia systems such as the World Wide Web (WWW). REST is
built on the concept of representations of resources. Resources can be
any coherent and meaningful concept that may be addressed. A URI is an
example of a resource. The representation of the resource is typically a
document that captures the current or intended state of the resource. An
example of a representation of a resource is an HTML page.

Heritrix uses REST to expose its functionality. The REST implementation
used by Heritrix is Restlet. Restlet implements the concepts defined by
REST, including resources and representations. It also provides a REST
container that processes RESTful requests. The container is the Noelios
Restlet Engine. For detailed information on Restlet,
visit \ http://www.restlet.org/.

Heritrix exposes its REST functionality through HTTPS. The HTTPS
protocol is used to send requests to retrieve or modify configuration
settings and manage crawl jobs.
