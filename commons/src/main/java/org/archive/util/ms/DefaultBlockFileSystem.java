/**
 * Default implementation of the Block File System.
 * 
 * <p>The overall structure of a BlockFileSystem file (such as a .doc file) is
 * as follows.  The file is divided into blocks, which are of uniform length
 * (512 bytes).  The first block (at file pointer 0) is called the header
 * block.  It's used to look up other blocks in the file.
 * 
 * <p>Subfiles contained within the .doc file are organized using a Block
 * Allocation Table, or BAT.  The BAT is basically a linked list; given a 
 * block number, the BAT will tell you the next block number.  Note that
 * the header block has no number; block #0 is the first block after the
 * header.  Thus, to convert a block number to a file pointer:
 * <code>int filePointer = (blockNumber + 1) * BLOCK_SIZE</code>.
 * 
 * <p>The BAT itself is discontinuous, however.  To find the blocks that 
 * comprise the BAT, you have to look in the header block.  The header block
 * contains an array of 109 pointers to the blocks that comprise the BAT.
 * If more than 109 BAT blocks are required (in other words, if the .doc
 * file is larger than ~6 megabytes), then something called the 
 * XBAT comes into play.
 * 
 * <p>XBAT blocks contain pointers to the 110th BAT block and beyond.
 * The first XBAT block is stored at a file pointer listed in the header.
 * The other XBAT blocks are always stored in order after the first; the 
 * XBAT table is continuous.  One is inclined to wonder why the BAT itself
 * is not so stored, but oh well.
 * 
 * <p>The BAT only tells you the next block for a given block.  To find the 
 * first block for a subfile, you have to look up that subfile's directory
 * entry.  Each directory entry is a 128 byte structure in the file, so four
 * of them fit in a block.  The number of the first block of the entry list
 * is stored in the header.  To find subsequent entry blocks, the BAT must
 * be used.
 * 
 * <p>I'm telling you all this so that you understand the caching that this
 * class provides.
 * 
 * <p>First, directory entries are not cached.  It's assumed that they will
 * be looked up at the beginning of a lengthy operation, and then forgotten
 * about.  This is certainly the case for {@link Doc#getText(BlockFileSystem, int)}. 
 * If you need to remember directory entries, you can manually store the Entry 
 * objects in a map or something, as they don't grow stale.
 * 
 * <p>This class keeps all 512 bytes of the header block in memory at all 
 * times.  This prevents a potentially expensive file pointer repositioning
 * every time you're trying to figure out what comes next.
 * 
 * <p>BAT and XBAT blocks are stored in a least-recently used cache.  The 
 * <i>n</i> most recent BAT and XBAT blocks are remembered, where <i>n</i>
 * is set at construction time.  The minimum value of <i>n</i> is 1.  For small
 * files, this can prevent file pointer repositioning for BAT look ups.
 * 
 * <p>The BAT/XBAT cache only takes up memory as needed.  If the specified
 * cache size is 100 blocks, but the file only has 4 BAT blocks, then only 
 * 2048 bytes will be used by the cache.
 * 
 * <p>Note this class only caches BAT and XBAT blocks.  It does not cache the
 * blocks that actually make up a subfile's contents.  It is assumed that those
 * blocks will only be accessed once per operation (again, this is what
 * {Doc.getText(BlockFileSystem)} typically requires.)
